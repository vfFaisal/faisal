    <h3>WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE?</h3>
    <p>
        <font>  
        Artificial intelligence is a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines
        capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.

    <h4>What Is AI?</h4>
    <P>
        Less than a decade after helping the Allied forces win World War II by breaking the Nazi encryption machine
        Enigma, mathematician Alan Turing changed history a second time with a simple question: “Can machines think?”

        Turing’s 1950 paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” and its subsequent Turing Test established the
        fundamental goal and vision of AI.

        At its core, AI is the branch of computer science that aims to answer Turing’s question in the affirmative. It
        is the endeavor to replicate or simulate human intelligence in machines. The expansive goal of AI has given rise
        to many questions and debates. So much so that no singular definition of the field is universally accepted.

    <h5>The Future of AI.</h5>

    <p>

        When one considers the computational costs and the technical data infrastructure running behind artificial
        intelligence, actually executing on AI is a complex and costly business. Fortunately, there have been massive
        advancements in computing technology, as indicated by Moore’s Law, which states that the number of transistors
        on a microchip doubles about every two years while the cost of computers is halved.

        Although many experts believe that Moore’s Law will likely come to an end sometime in the 2020s, this has had a
        major impact on modern AI techniques — without it, deep learning would be out of the question, financially
        speaking. Recent research found that AI innovation has actually outperformed Moore’s Law, doubling every six
        months or so as opposed to two years.

        By that logic, the advancements artificial intelligence has made across a variety of industries have been major
        over the last several years. And the potential for an even greater impact over the next several decades seems
        all but inevitable.

        </font>The Four Types of Artificial Intelligence
    </h6>


    <p>

        AI can be divided into four categories, based on the type and complexity of the tasks a system is able to
        perform. For example, automated spam filtering falls into the most basic class of AI, while the far-off
        potential for machines that can perceive people’s thoughts and emotions is part of an entirely different AI
        subset.

    <h1 backgorund="file:///H:/blocks/background.jpeg">Conclusion</h1>
    <p>AI holds the key to unlocking a magnificent future where, driven by data and computers that understand our world,
        we will all make more informed decisions. These computers of the future will understand not just how to turn on
        the switches but why the switches need to be turned on.</p>




    <p>Theory of mind is just that — theoretical. We have not yet achieved the technological and scientific capabilities
        necessary to reach this next level of AI.

        The concept is based on the psychological premise of understanding that other living things have thoughts and
        emotions that affect the behavior of one’s self. In terms of AI machines, this would mean that AI could
        comprehend how humans, animals and other machines feel and make decisions through self-reflection and
        determination, and then will utilize that information to make decisions of their own. Essentially, machines
        would have to be able to grasp and process the concept of “mind,” the fluctuations of emotions in decision
        making and a litany of other psychological concepts in real time, creating a two-way relationship between people
        and AI.</p>
